{"name":"Pgmapcss","tagline":"PGMapCSS is a library for PostgreSQL/PostGIS which works between an osm2pgsql based database and Mapnik (and maybe other renderers). It processes database (usually OpenStreetMap) objects according to MapCSS rules and calculates resulting colors, widths and other properties for Symbolizers, even geometric modifications.","body":"== PGMapCSS ==\r\nPGMapCSS is an implementation of [[http://www.mapcss.org/|MapCSS]] in Postgresql\r\n/ plpgsql for use with [[http://www.mapnik.org/|Mapnik]] (but should work with other programs too). Therefore you can\r\nreduce your Mapnik stylesheet to a minimum; all style calculation is done in\r\nthe database, providing more advanced functionality.\r\n\r\nThere were already several efforts to implement stylesheets based on Cascading Stylesheets (CSS) for Mapnik:\r\n* [[https://github.com/mapnik/Cascadenik|Cascadenik]]\r\n* [[http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Carto|CartoCSS]]\r\n\r\nAll these tools are pre-processors, that convert a CSS stylesheet into a Mapnik stylesheet. PGMapCSS takes a different approach: The stylesheet is compiled into PostgreSQL/plpgsql functions which are evaluated at runtime. Therefore more advanced calculations are possible, even geometric modifications. Read [[doc/MapCSS.creole]] to learn about the features of PGMapCSS's MapCSS implementation.\r\n\r\n**[[examples/README.md|Show me some examples!]]**\r\n\r\nThe Mapnik style just contains a single database query and the basic styles, referencing all options from the database queries. You can think of those styles as templates, which you can reference from your style sheet.\r\n\r\nAs Mapnik 2.2 does not support using expressions for most symbolizer parameters, some pre-processing on the Mapnik Stylefile has to take place. The Mapnik XML file is generated from a template.\r\n\r\nPGMapCSS is designed for Mapnik but might work with other renderers too. See file [[doc/compatibility.creole|Compatibility]] for more information.\r\n\r\nDevelopers: Every compiled style consists of a couple of PostgreSQL functions. See [[doc/API.md]] for details.\r\n\r\nShare this:\r\n* [[https://flattr.com/submit/auto?user_id=plepe&url=https://github.com/plepe/pgmapcss&title=PGMapCSS&language=&tags=github&category=software|Flattr this!]]\r\n* [[https://github.com/plepe/pgmapcss|Fork me on GitHub]]\r\n\r\nFind installation instructions in [[doc/install.md]].\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
