== Data Types ==
In fact all values are internally stored as strings, but are converted to data types as needed. Therefore, when a data type is required below, this is just a reference.

* //value//: An unspecified value.
* //none//: An empty string or (postgresql) NULL value. The result of a calculation error (e.g. 2//0).
* //string//: Any text; may be enclosed in quotes ("..." or '...'). (//none// is an empty string).
* //key//: A string which is used as key of tag or a property.
* //number//: A chain of digits, may contain a '.' for a decimal point. (//none// is treated as 0). May be suffixed by a unit name (see below).
* //boolean//: true or false. If expression equals 0, "no", "false" or //none// the value is considerd false, true otherwise. If a function returns a boolean value, "true" or "false" is returned.

== Units ==
If you read a number, unit conversion takes place. The following units are supported:
|= Unit |= Description
| px | Pixel on the screen (default)
| u | Units in 900913 projection
| m | Meters on the ground (TODO: currently equals 'u').

== Operators ==
|= Operator |= Description
| +, -, *, / | arithmetic operations
| >, >=, <=, < | number comparison
| , or ; | several statements separated by , or ; will always return the value of the last statement.

== Functions ==
|= Function |= Parameters |= Return value |= Description
| add, sub, mul, div | number, [number, [number, ...]] | number | arithmetic operations
| gt, ge, le, lt | number, number | boolean | compares to numbers. >, >=, <= or <.
| sqrt | number | number | Square root of input value
| prop | key, [key, [key, ...]] | value | current value of the computed property (in the current layer). If several keys are passed, the first found key is returned. E.g. prop("width")
| tag | key, [key, [key, ...]] | value | value of the tag key (e.g. tag("name") ). If several keys are passed, the first set tag is returned, e.g. tag("name:en", "int_name", "name").
| concat | string, [string, [string, ...]] | string | Concatenate all strings
| any | value, [value, [value, ...]] | value | Returns first value that's not //none//.
| boolean | value | boolean | Converts the input to "true" or "false" (see 'Data Types' for an explanation).
| cond | boolean, value, [value] | value | if first input parameter is //boolean// true returns the second parameter, otherwise the third parameter (or "").
| number | value | number | Converts the input to a number (or "").
