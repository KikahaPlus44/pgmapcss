Housenumbers
============
Professional maps usually have the housenumbers rotated to be parallel to the associated street. The following mapcss file achieves this, by using an invisible line where the housenumber is printed on. The right image shows a "debug" view, where the construction of the "invisible" (here blue) line is shown. You can remove all statements marked with "DEBUG" from the mapcss file.
