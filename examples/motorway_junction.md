Layering roads of a motorway junction
=====================================
pgmapcss automatically layers objects by its 'layer' tag, therefore the roads and bridges in the image automatically get layered correctly. You may force a specific layer by setting a property 'layer', e.g. area[landuse] { layer: -10; }.
