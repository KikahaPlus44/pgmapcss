Example 2: Layering roads
=========================
This example shows how eval-statements for z-index can be used to layer roads correctly.

Warning: This example needs Mapnik branch 'stroke-width-expr' or version 3.0 and accompaning modifications in file default-template.mapnik (search for 'stroke-width-expr' for details). If you run this example with Mapnik 2.2 the casing might be missing.
